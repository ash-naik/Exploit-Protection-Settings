# Windows 10 Exploit Protection Settings

## Applying exploit protection policies
The settings XML files found here can be applied via PowerShell with the
following commands (as admin):

  1. Verify that the file is valid:

    Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\ExploitProtectionSettings.xml -IsValid

  2. Apply the policy:

    Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\ExploitProtectionSettings.xml

Note that applying settings using this method will not remove existing
settings. However, existing settings that conflict with the applied settings
will be overwritten.

## Formatting XML files

### In PowerShell:

    $settings = Get-Content ./ExploitProtectionSettings.xml
    $settings -replace "([A-z`"]{1}) ([A-z]{1})", "$('$1')`n      $('$2')"

### In Sublime Text:
In regex replace mode, replace this:

    ([A-z"]{1}) ([A-z]{1})

With this:

    $1
          $2

## Glossary
The table below provides a glossary of Process Mitigation-related terms and how
they relate to each other throughout the different interfaces.
